\noindent
I would first like to express thanks to my project supervisor, Dr John Bullinaria, for his guidance throughout the duration of the project. 

I also want to thank Mia Wright and the wellbeing team at the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences, who have been invaluable in providing support throughout my time at the University.

Lastly, I want to extend my unbounded gratitude to my parents and to Amelia Elgey. Without their support I would not have been able to complete this project.
