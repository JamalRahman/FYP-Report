My madireddy results are more intuitive than Madireddy's
UT=LT makes for optimal flow as the road operates on a 1-in-1-out basis

\section{Greed}

\subsection{Proportion of pop}

Redo. Had no trend but I did the experiment at greedy threshold = 0
Try redo at greedy threshold = 0.2 or whatever is optimal for that particular population size 

\subsection{greedy threshold}
A zero greedy threshold, while incredibly unrealistic, will cause agents to divert from their planned route and seek out a new route at every junction, regardless of congestion level. Contrastingly, a greedy threshold of $1$ will only direct an agent to seek a new route if their current route is maximally congested. It is hypothesised that there is a greedy threshold which will minimise the clearance time of a road network.

optimal greedy threshold seems to depend on population size

Need to take base (no greedy decisions) measurement for all populations as well!
